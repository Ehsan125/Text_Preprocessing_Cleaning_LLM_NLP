# Text Chunking Strategies for Large Language Models (LLMs)

This repository demonstrates various text chunking strategies used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for preparing data for Large Language Models (LLMs). Chunking is a critical preprocessing step that divides text into manageable pieces to fit into a model's context window while preserving coherence, focus, and context.

## Chunking Strategies Implemented

### 1. **Sentence-Level Chunking**
   - **Description:** Splits the text into chunks based on individual sentences.
   - **Use Cases:** Best for applications that require a fine-grained focus, like chatbots or simple query systems.
   - **Advantages:** Maintains high focus on sentence-level details.
   - **Disadvantages:** May lose broader context if sentences are highly dependent on each other.

### 2. **Paragraph-Level Chunking**
   - **Description:** Chunks are created at the paragraph level, keeping several related sentences together.
   - **Use Cases:** Ideal for complex queries or in-depth content analysis where multi-sentence understanding is crucial.
   - **Advantages:** Preserves the flow of ideas across related sentences.
   - **Disadvantages:** Larger chunks may exceed the LLM's context window, potentially leading to irrelevant information retrieval.

### 3. **Topic-Based Chunking**
   - **Description:** Divides text based on topics or themes, grouping sentences or paragraphs that revolve around specific subjects.
   - **Use Cases:** Useful for organizing documents with diverse topics, such as legal, medical, or research databases.
   - **Advantages:** Provides thematic responses, improves retrieval for broad or thematic queries.
   - **Disadvantages:** May lose granularity if topics are not carefully distinguished.

### 4. **Fixed-Size Chunking**
   - **Description:** Chunks are generated based on a fixed number of words or tokens.
   - **Use Cases:** Often used in scenarios where uniform chunk sizes are necessary, such as document storage or retrieval.
   - **Advantages:** Simple and predictable chunk sizes.
   - **Disadvantages:** May cut off sentences, causing coherence loss.

### 5. **Context-Aware Chunking Using Embeddings**
   - **Description:** Uses embeddings to create chunks based on semantic similarity. Sentences with high similarity are grouped together.
   - **Use Cases:** High-quality LLM responses where context understanding is essential, such as customer service or academic research.
   - **Advantages:** Retains semantic coherence and adjusts dynamically to the content's complexity.
   - **Disadvantages:** More computationally expensive due to the need for embedding calculations.

### 6. **Hybrid Chunking**
   - **Description:** Combines multiple strategies (e.g., topic and sentence-level chunking) to balance focus, coherence, and context preservation.
   - **Use Cases:** Suitable for complex datasets where both context and detail are important.
   - **Advantages:** Provides flexibility and maximizes both focus and context.
   - **Disadvantages:** Can be more complex to implement and configure.

## Why Chunking?

Chunking helps to fit long documents or texts into the context window of LLMs. It enhances performance by:
- Improving focus and coherence of model predictions.
- Ensuring that only relevant information is passed to the model.
- Handling long text inputs efficiently by breaking them into digestible pieces.
